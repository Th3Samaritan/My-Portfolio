Web Application (OWASP Top 10 Focus)

[ ] A01: Broken Access Control: Can I access admin panels? (e.g., /admin, /dashboard)

[ ] A01: Can I access other users' data by changing IDs in URLs/API requests? (IDOR)

[ ] A02: Cryptographic Failures: Is sensitive data (passwords, PII) transmitted over HTTP?

[ ] A02: Is data stored unencrypted in cookies or localStorage?

[ ] A03: Injection: Test all input fields for XSS (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>)

[ ] A03: Test all inputs for SQL Injection (e.g., ' OR '1'='1)

[ ] A04: Insecure Design: Is there proper rate limiting on login/password reset forms?

[ ] A05: Security Misconfiguration: Are directory listings enabled?

[ ] A05: Are default credentials in use for any part of the stack?

[ ] A06: Vulnerable Components: Check all JS libraries for known CVEs.

[ ] A07: Identification & Authentication: Is 2FA weak or bypassable?

[ ] A07: Is there a weak password policy?

[ ] A08: Software & Data Integrity: Check for Deserialization vulnerabilities.

[ ] A09: Security Logging & Monitoring: Attempt an attack; does the system lock me out?

[ ] A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): If the app fetches a URL, can I make it request http://127.0.0.1 or internal IPs?

REST API Checklist

[ ] Auth: Is authentication (Bearer token, API Key) enforced on all endpoints?

[ ] Auth: Can I use a token from User A to access User B's data?

[ ] BOLA (IDOR): Test for IDOR on all GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints (e.g., /api/users/{id})

[ ] Mass Assignment: POST or PUT with extra fields (e.g., "isAdmin": true, "balance": 99999)

[ ] Data Exposure: Do GET endpoints return sensitive data (e.g., password hashes, PII)?

[ ] Rate Limiting: Is there rate limiting on auth endpoints and expensive queries?

[ ] Verb Tampering: Can I use GET instead of POST or PUT instead of PATCH?

[ ] Injection: Test for SQLi, NoSQLi, and Command Injection in all parameters.

[ ] Misconfiguration: Are any debug modes or error stacks returned?

GraphQL API Checklist

[ ] Introspection: Is the Introspection Query enabled? Can I get the full schema?

[ ] Auth: Are all queries and mutations protected by authentication?

[ ] Authorization: Can I use a valid query to access data I shouldn't be able to? (e.g., a user query that returns all users, not just me)

[ ] Denial of Service (DoS): Test for deep or recursive queries (e.g., user { posts { comments { user { ... } } } })

[ ] Injection: Are any user-controlled inputs passed directly to database resolvers?

[ ] Data Exposure: Do object types return sensitive fields (e.g., privateApiKey)?
