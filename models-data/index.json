"description": "A detailed look at the internal wing spar structure. This model was used for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in Ansys to simulate composite failure modes under high-G maneuvers. The final design used a T700 carbon fiber layup for maximum strength-to-weight ratio. (This is just a demo box, but you'd replace it with your wing model)."
