Searching the Web with AIDate: March 11, 2025Based on my own experience, and as someone who is always inculcating the idiot index principles in my work, I must say using AI to search for somethings might not always be right, because I have observed that sometimes AI gives you answers based on what it feels are top most answers, and feed you with that, hence limited options, but when you do it yourself you find more answers and get more options. AI is good and all but be hybrid in your approach. Don't just rely totally on it, we all know it can be BS sometimes. Well just wanted to air this here. #Th3Samaritan.
