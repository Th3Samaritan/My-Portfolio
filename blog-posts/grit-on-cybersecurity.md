Grit on Cybersecurity

Date: April 22, 2025

Been doing a lot of practicing on portswigger lab lately along the way I noticed something I don't like client side attacks that much, find myself loving the server side so much that I am thinking of creating custom tools. Lol used to think I was good with burpsuite lately I have realized I didn't know as much I do now burp suite is quite robust man for real it's a whole toolkit on its own.
