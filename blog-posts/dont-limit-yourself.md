For the past few weeks my mind has been chaotic lots of things I want to get done, but some how it's not happening anyway, I did it again I successfully created a 3d filament using HDPE and guess what tomorrow I am going to be doing a 3d print of a model using that same filament... #Maverick. It doesn't have to make sense to everyone as long as it makes sense to you. So don't think just do. #Th3Samaritan.
